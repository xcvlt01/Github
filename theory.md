(https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/basic-git-commands)

### Whenever you create a new project:

- go on github and add new repo and follow the steps from there.

If you work on someone else's repo:

- use git clone command and clone the repo to your local environment

### Flow of git:

- always branch off "main" and create your own branch and only work on that
- don't forget to save the file in your VsCode
- create commits after smaller chunks of work
- push it to your branch on Github
- if your work is ready propose a merge into main branch and create a pull request
- wait for someone else to check your code and merge it

### Git commands for workflow:

- _git init_: initialise new repo locally
- _git clone_: clone repo from github to your local environment
- _git branch_: check branch you're on
- _git checkout "destinaton branch name"_: move to specific branch
- _git checkout -b_: create new branch
- _git add ._: add file before commit !!here is where you have to make sure you saved the file in VsC!!
- _git commit -m "commit message"_: give a discription on what you've done in the code
- _git push_: push it to Github

- _git pull_: you always have to pull down the latest version of the main branch to be up to date with the code
