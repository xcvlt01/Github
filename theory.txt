https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/basic-git-commands

Whenever you create a new project:

- go on github and add new repo and follow the steps from there.

If you work on someone elses repo:
 
- use git clone command and clone the repo to your local environment

Flow of git:

- always branch off "main" and create your own branch and only work on that
- don't forget to save the file in your VsCode
- create commits after smaller chunks of work
- whenever you push go to Github and create a pull request
- wait for someone else to check your code and merge it 

Git commands for workflow:

- git init : initialise new repo locally 
- git clone: clone repo from github to your local environment
- git branch: check branch you're on
- git checkout "destinaton branch name" : move to specific branch
- git checkout -b : create new branch
- git add . : add file before commit (here is where you have to make sure you saved the file in VsC!!)
- git commit -m "commit message": give a discription on what you've done in the code
- git push: push it to Github
